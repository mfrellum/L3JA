An electronic portfolio based on L3JA could probably replace grades in theory. But will it in real life?

If you could show effectiv use of somthing like L3JA. Your employeer would probably hire you and your L3JA. Not all work will require a L3JA. E.g. for some manual labore. 

To have a real impact systems like L3JA need to be an integrated and accepted part of society.

In a hireing situation you need to present a portfolio generated from your L3JA related to the taskes you are expected to solve in your new job. Maybe it can flag other taskes in the organization you can solve, but are not part of the requierments, too.
