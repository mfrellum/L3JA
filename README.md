LifeLong Learning Journal &amp; Archive  is a [mfrellum/seedProject](https://github.com/mfrellum/seedProject).

This project is greatly inspiered by the [OLPC-project](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/The_OLPC_Wiki) and in particulare the [Sugar Journal Activity](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Journal_Activity).

### Turning into Soft cyborgs
We are increasingly dependent of our smart devices. Instead of remembering things - we are getting fast at looking up things. Add something like Google Glass - and apart from being able to putting the device away - we are cyborgs.
**Don't get scared!** It is not the first time humans have been transformed by technology. Writing is one similar historic technologi. What happened to the Bard? he became a play-writer ;)

### Keeping a Journal
Most students - to some extent - make lecture notes. Some even use the notes when they work through the examples after the lecture or prepare for their exam. A few even use their notes when they later conduct the work they have prepared to do through all those years of studying! Some *crazy people* even keep taking notes as they work!! ;)

A activity journal like the [Sugar Journal Activity](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Journal_Activity) makes it easier to keep a journal of your computer/device activeties since it automatically records context metadata to your activety so it is easier to recall it by search and your episodic memory.

### The learning Journal
This journal (idea) software differ from the Sugar Journal Activity mostly in the way it integrates with Learning Activities (Apps). It will have a suggestion engine that flag relevant - previously completed - learning activities to the task at hand. It will also flag learning activities that have been updated and you can get/buy an update. Metadata will always be kept in the journal and data that you make or have the right to store are stored in your personal data archive. Ideally it will be your lifelong partly automated instruction manual for what you know - but have slightly forgotten - and quick brain-update service.

### Dependencies/parts
- Something like [mfrellum/littlebrother](https://github.com/mfrellum/littlebrother) for metadata storage and search
- Something like [mfrellum/PragmaMS](https://github.com/mfrellum/PragmaMS) for archiving data
