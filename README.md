Life Long Learning Journal &amp; Archive

This project is greatly inspiered by the [OLPC-project](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/The_OLPC_Wiki) and in particulare the [Sugar Journal Activity](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Journal_Activity). 

### Turning into Soft cyborgs
We are incrisingly dependent of our smart devices. Instead of remembering things - we are getting fast at looking up things. Add something like Google Glass - and apart from being able to putting the device away - we are cyborgs. **Don't get scared!** It is not the first time humans have been transformed by technologi. Writing is one similar historic technologi. What happend to the Bard? he became a playwriter ;)

### Keeping a Journal
Most students - to some extent - make lecture notes. Some even use the notes when they work through the examples after the lecture or prepere for their exam. A few even use their notes when they later conduct the work they have prepered to do throug all those years of studying! Some *creazy people* even keep taking notes as they work!! ;)

A file (activity) journal like the [Sugar Journal Activity](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Journal_Activity) makes it easier to keep a journal of your computer activeties since it automatically records contecs metadata to your activety so it is easier to recall it by search and your episodic memory.

### The learning Journal
This journal (idea) software differ from the Sugar Journal Activity mostly in the way it integrates with Learning Activeties (Apps). It will have a suggestion engien that flag relevant - previously compleated - learning activeties. It will also flag learning activeties that have been updated and you can get/buy an update. Metadata will allways be keept in the journal and data that you make or have the right to store are stored in your personal data archive.

### Dependensies/parts
- Something like [mfrellum/littlebrother](https://github.com/mfrellum/littlebrother) for metadata storage and search
- Something like [mfrellum/PragmaMS](https://github.com/mfrellum/PragmaMS) for archiving data
