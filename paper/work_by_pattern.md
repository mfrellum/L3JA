# Work by pattern
Many office tasks can probably folow a [Design pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern). An automated system for 
inputing office tasks and sugesting patterns would be of greate interest in making a system for analysing tasks and suggesting
soulutions, tell you if you have the nessesary skills to solve the task, need to learn a new skill to solve it, or hire someone
to compleate parts of the task.
